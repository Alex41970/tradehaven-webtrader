-- Phase 1: Remove all non-crypto assets and their related data
-- This migration deletes commodities, forex, stocks, and indices, leaving only cryptocurrency assets

-- Step 1: Delete trade execution logs for non-crypto trades
DELETE FROM trade_execution_log 
WHERE trade_id IN (
  SELECT t.id FROM trades t
  JOIN assets a ON t.asset_id = a.id
  WHERE a.category IN ('commodities', 'forex', 'stocks', 'indices')
);

-- Step 2: Delete trades for non-crypto assets
DELETE FROM trades 
WHERE asset_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM assets WHERE category IN ('commodities', 'forex', 'stocks', 'indices')
);

-- Step 3: Delete any user favorites for non-crypto assets
DELETE FROM user_favorites
WHERE asset_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM assets WHERE category IN ('commodities', 'forex', 'stocks', 'indices')
);

-- Step 4: Delete all non-crypto assets
DELETE FROM assets WHERE category IN ('commodities', 'forex', 'stocks', 'indices');

-- Step 5: Delete any orphaned price history for deleted assets
DELETE FROM price_history 
WHERE symbol NOT IN (SELECT symbol FROM assets WHERE category = 'crypto');

-- Step 6: Remove AllTick cron job if it exists
